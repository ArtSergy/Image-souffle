# Image-suffle

Simple python script to randomize pixels position in any image. For now only .jpg supported. To use the program place the file named input.jpg in the main directory. All pictures and the final gif will be created in the output directory

you can override the following values to alter the gif's properties:
```python
FPS = 30                #Frames per second
duration = 2            #Duration in seconds
```
